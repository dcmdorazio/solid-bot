# solid-bot
Most generic Discord.js bot created with the help of https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin

**Uses** 

`args-info` provides information about arguments

`avatar` returns the user's avatar link

`beep` returns a snide remark about thinking the bot so stupid as to fall for this trick

`ping` does much the same as `beep`

`help` gives information about the commands

`prune` will delete a specified amount of messages


**Make it Yours!**

  To make this bot yours, simply clone the files and add a `config.json` inside of the main repository. Mine looks like this: 
  ```json
{
  "prefix": "_",
  "token": "<insert token>"
}
```

Be sure to install all the packages listed in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `.eslintrc.json`!
